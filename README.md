A website for a new design studio called "What You Design".

Created with Vue.js.

## Supported devices/browsers

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The website works great on all browsers except WebKit browsers. This means that the website is very buggy and unpredictable while browsing in Safari and all iOS browsers. During testing, I have found that it works great for some iPhone users and horrible for others. Currently actively trying to fix this.

The website seems to work perfectly as intended on Windows, Android and MacOS when using Chrome, Firefox and Edge.
